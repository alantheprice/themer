# A Prototype theme switcher.
### Designed simply to show a pattern for theming a site using css without inline scripts or inline styles.

* Simply a prototype to demonstrate a pattern, not a fully fleshed out project.

#### Design: 

1. Seperate out all colors and potentially other theme attributes from the rest of the css layout.
  * All themes (colors etc.) live in a seperate css file. 
  * All layout, non-themeable attributes live in a more traditional css file likely generated by Sass.
2. Uses multiple css-classes to compose the layout and apply themes to particular elements.
3. Uses default themes if no themes are defined.
4. Dynamically build css files client-side when a theme has been applied.
5. Uses an id on the theme link-tag to ensure that only one theme applies and that we don't polute the DOM with multiple overriding styles.

Quick start of the prototype: 

In terminal/bash, enter: *NOTE: nodeJS must be installed.
